## Settings

There is a file ("vgiws/settings/settings.py") that contains the configurations about the system.


### Bounding Box Settings

Inside the settings.py file, there is a dictionary that contains the spatial restriction of the system.
By default it is the Bounding Box (BB) of the SÃ£o Paulo city.

The developer can change the BB for other about another city, such as Rio de Janeiro or Belo Horizonte.

The default dictionary is something like this:

```
__SPATIAL_BB__ = {
    "xmin": 313389.67,
    "ymin": 7343788.61,
    "xmax": 360663.23,
    "ymax": 7416202.05,
    "EPSG": 29193,
}
```

The BB can be found by QGIS in Layer Properties > Metadata > Extent.
